# Powers-of-all-government-levels-in-Constitution-of-Nepal-2015
I have attempted to avail viewers to receive and re-use the powers of all three types of governments of Nepal conferred to by The Constitution of Nepal 2015.  
The Constitution of Nepal 2015 has stated such powers into 5 different schedules **Scheule 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)** indicating exclusive as well as concurrent powers. 
Such schedules are maintained under separate tabs for a convenient viewing. 
The spreadsheet is available in the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YFru_4K26TqETbyGgTUDrQH-g4_3yeq_egTixTBnYF0/edit#gid=418438455
